# Swamped

This is a soft copy of the files for the Swamped group project.

Some of the assets I worked on:
- [./Assets/Audio/](./Assets/Audio/) (I was responsible for all audio in the game.)
- [./Assets/Scripts/DailyUpdates/Components/DailyItemGeneration.cs](./Assets/Scripts/DailyUpdates/Components/DailyItemGeneration.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/DailyUpdates/Components/StoryDialogue.cs](./Assets/Scripts/DailyUpdates/Components/StoryDialogue.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Items/ItemWindow.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Items/ItemWindow.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Items/RobotsWithQuantity.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Items/RobotsWithQuantity.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Level/Enemy.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Level/Enemy.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Level/Goal.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Level/LevelGoal.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Missions/Components/MissionMenu.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Missions/Components/MissionMenu.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Notifications/ResourceNotification.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Notifications/ResourceNotification.cs)

Please note: 
- The list above focuses on Script assets. I also worked on other assets (scripts, UI, scenes, etc.) that go along with those scripts or deliverables I held responsibility for completing. Those deliverables are listed in my [portfolio](https://tychunedu.github.io/gamedev.html#swamped). Because of the large scale of the project, there are too many assets to list.
- This was a <ins>group</ins> project. <ins>This means that we have worked on each other's assets, making additions or changes as needed.</ins> Examples are:
  - I needed to add to multiple scripts that other group members worked on to add code for audio.
  - Naturally, I had to work with on the [Item.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Items/Item.cs) script for the Item Details deliverable.
  - Naturally, I had to modify existitng code that other people made for the Crafting Failure Rates deliverable.
  - This also includes bug fixes.
