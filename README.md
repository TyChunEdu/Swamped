# Swamped

This is a soft copy of the files for the Swamped group project.

Assets I worked on:
- [./Assets/Audio](./Assets/Audio) (I was responsible for all audio in the game.)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Missions/Components/MissionMenu.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Missions/Components/MissionMenu.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Level/Enemy.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Level/Enemy.cs)
- [./Assets/Scripts/Level/Goal.cs](./Assets/Scripts/Level/LevelGoal.cs)

Please note: 
- The list above focuses on Script assets. I also worked on other assets that go along with those scripts or deliverables I held responsibility for completing. Those deliverables are listed in my [portfolio](https://tychunedu.github.io/gamedev.html#swamped). Because of the large scale of the project, there are too many assets to list.
- This was a ***group*** project. This means that we have worked on each other's assets, making additions or changes as needed.
